# Razz's Website

> This is no longer the code for my website. I've ported this site to React Static and now lives at [itisrazza/razza.io](https://github.com/itisrazza/razza.io).

This is my very own website. It's not too fancy, but it's a hub for a few links and projects.

It was originally written in HTML/CSS with PHP ([and a blog I've written for an assignment](https://github.com/itisrazza/wodp-engine)) as a templating system back in 2016, reworked a few good times (last PHP rework was in 2019, when I started uni).

Later in 2021, I plunged in to reworking it in React (so I can learn it) and have hosted on my PHP server. Later on, I've dropped the server in favour of GitHub pages. And now I've dropped React in favour of React Static, so I can view it in older browsers.
