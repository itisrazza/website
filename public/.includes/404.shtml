<h2>Sorry. I dropped the ball.</h2>
<p>The file you're looking for doesn't seem to be here.</p>
<p>It could have disappeared into the void, or a <code>void*</code> was <code>free</code>d before its time. I might've existed in the past
    but got deleted in the (n-1)th website interation...
    only God knows.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unless it's in <a href="/files">files</a>, I generally avoid file extentions.</li>
    <li>If it's a link from before 2019, I guarantee it's broken.</li>
    <li>Try <a href="/">going home</a> and go from there.</li>
</ul>
